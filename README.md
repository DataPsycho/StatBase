# StatBase
StatBase is a quick lookup point for all beginner to advance
Numerical algorithm is being used in Machine Learning. It will
cover the building block of the algorithms from beginner point
of view and also with the application with test or real world
data.

### The Building Phase:
The basic algorithms will be build in a class based approach
following the book mentioned and stored as a package/module. 
It is actually exactly same copy of the codes taken from book 
repository. The package is called `neuralbase`. Then later 
the models will be imported from `neuralbase` in the notebooks 
and applied in the data source.
- Chapter 1: Tour of Models

### The Application Phase:
The custom algorithm from building phase and other helper 
packages  will used in the real world data in that section. 
They will presented in a short mathematical manner too if 
needed to explain the hyper parameters.
