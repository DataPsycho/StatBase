# StatBase
StatBase is a quick lookup point for all beginner to advance
Numerical algorithm is being used in Machine Learning. It will
cover the building block of the algorithms from beginner point
of view and also with the application with test or real world
data.

### The Building Phase:
The basic algorithms will be build in a class based approach
and stored as a package/module. The later the models will be
imported in the notebooks and applied several data sources.

### The Application Phase:
The algorithm and other packages have already build the
algorithm will used in the real world data in that section.
They will presented in a very mathematical and elaborate way.
