Data Pre Processing and Feature Selection
First section of the notebook has covered common and very general
data engineering task before building models. The second section is
all about SBS or Backward Selection algorithm and feature importance
analysis. That is very important concept usually overlooked. As the
features grows in size makes it difficult to decide which features
are more important to use in a model.
