Feature Engineering Via PCA, LDA and KPCA
---
this chapter is dedicated to Feature Engineering techniques like PCA, KDA and KPCA.
PCA is unsupervised method which project the actual vector space to a new vector 
space with highest variation. Where LDA is based on the between and within class 
variation. In case if the data is not linearly separable the Kernel PCA is used.
